Notes on the logs -

In my implementation, the executable (scan.py) for the scanner controls whether or not the token for "whspace" will be logged.
I have run two cases as of the submission due date: hardtestcase.txt and big_test.txt
The hardtestcase.txt has been run with whspace enabled. The latter was logged without whspace.
Both use the same tables.
