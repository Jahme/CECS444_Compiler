This folder contains images of the DFAs created and implemented into the scanner.

I went straight to constructing DFAs from the regex expressions in the tokens.txt file provided to us rather than constructing NFAs for every token.\
The included DFAs encompass what I consider the more difficult portions of creating the state table.\
The full DFA of all states is included as well.
